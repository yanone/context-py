## Inherited Properties

As a subclass of `BaseObject`, this class also has these properties:

### user_data

* Python type: `dict`

Optional dictionary for format-specific data. This is stored as `_` in the Context-JSON serialization. Use this to store custom metadata that should be preserved when reading and writing files.

*If not provided, defaults to* `{}`.
